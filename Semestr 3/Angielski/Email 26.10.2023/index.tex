    \opening{Hi Adam!}

    I hope you have a great journey! I've read a few posts about your trip on Facebook college fanpage and I must
    admit that the views on pictures are breathtaking. I'm sure you have met a lot of people and you have got a
    lot of stories to tell. 
    
    I would like to invite you on a meeting with first-year students who are interested in
    going on the same trip this year.The talk is scheduled for 
    25th of November at C-13 building on Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology. 
    I believe your unique perspective will greatly benefit our students, helping them make the most out of their study trip.

    Please let me know if this date and time work for you, or if you have any preferences. 
    Additionally, if there are any specific topics or areas you would like to focus on during your talk, 
    please feel free to share your thoughts.I think that your experience would be very valuable for them.

    I'm sure that group will be very interested in your stories and "survival" tips. 
    
    Safe travels, and we can't wait to see you soon!
    \closing{Yours faithfully, M.P.}
